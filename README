SQLCrypt
========

Lots of ActiveRecord attributes need encryption (passwords, salary information, account balances, etc.)
Typically this encryption is handled in Ruby code. However, there are two problems with this: it can be slow,
especially if encrypting/decrypting for large numbers of model objects; and if multiple applications
in different languages are accessing the encrypted fields in the database, you have to make sure the
encryption algorithms match.

SQLCrypt remedies these problems by allowing attributes to be specified as encrypted using database
encryption functions.

Right now, the only database encryption function supported is MySQL aes_encrypt/aes_decrypt, which
expects an encrypted field of type string. See "Extending" below for how to support other databases. 


Example
=======

class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  sql_encrypted :balance, :key => 'my_secret_key'


For the MySQL adapter, this will cause the "balance" field to be stored as

hex(aes_encrypt(actual_balance, 'my_secret_key_#{id}'))

and retrieved using

aes_decrypt(unhex(balance), 'my_secret_key_#{id}')


id is the primary key of the account; this guarantees that the same value will encrypt to different 
results in different records (thus making deducing anything from database inspection more difficult).

You can specify multiple fields on the same line if they are using the same key; use separate lines for different keys. For example,

  sql_encrypted :cc_number, :ssn, :key => 'fIn^nce-dan{}er'
  sql_encrypted :password, :key => 'password'

will encrypt "cc_number" and "ssn" using the key 'fIn^nce-dan{}er' and "password" using the key 'password'.


Extending
=========

Support for additional databases can be added by adding a module named "<database_adapter_name>_encryption" 
to the lib/adapters directory. The module must implement two methods:

encryption_find(name, key, options) to specify the SQL for reading the column 
encryption_set(name, key, options) to specify the SQL for persisting to the column

where "name" is the field name of the attribute and "key" is the secret key specified in sql_encrypted.

SQLCrypt automatically tries to load the module that corresponds with the name of the database adapter for
the ActiveRecord class using it. If the adapter is not present, an error is thrown.
